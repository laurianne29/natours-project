## About

Here is my first one page create in Scss with some advanced Css properties. This is from a course available on Udemy done by Jonas Schmedtmann called "Advanced CSS and Sass".

This is the first project of the course which we can divided into three part : 
* <strong>natours-project :
  * Advanced Css and Scss
  * Advanced Responsive Design</strong>

* trillo-project :
  * Master Flexbox

* nexter-project :
  * Master Css Grid Layouts

## Requirements

* <strong>nodeJS</strong>, link here: <https://nodejs.org>
* <strong>package.json file</strong>: for that just write `npm init` on the terminal being sure to be into the project folder.
* <strong>node-sass package</strong>: write `npm install node-sass --save-dev`. The `--save-dev` is to be saved as a development dependency, it's like a tool for this project. If the package.json file is already in the folder, just write `npm install` which will install automatically the node-sass package.

### Compile
To compile our scss into css code: run the script compile:sass, for that just write `npm run compile:sass`.

### Reload
The command `live-server` will automatically reload the page on the browser each time you save your file.

## Note
Actually some of the advanced css properties used to create complex css animations in this project are not supported by all browsers, spacially by IE 7, 8 or Edge maybe more. 
So, just take a look here <https://caniuse.com/> to know the compatibility with every browsers.
